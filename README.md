# blockchain_network_data_study
An exploratory study examining the relationships between network data from public blockchains

This is a completely self directed project. I am self taught in python and ML libraries. 
Currently working to optimise the model as I learn more about ML, optimisation and applications. 

Will upload as I go along!
If you have any comments or thoughts, feel free to reach out!
